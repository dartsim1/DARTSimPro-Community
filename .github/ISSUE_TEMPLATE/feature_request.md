- [ ] General Feedback (e.g., usability suggestions, overall experience)

### Description
Describe your feature request or feedback in detail. For example:
- Feature: "Add pediatric-specific capnography waveforms for PALS training."
- Feedback: "The scenario editor is powerful but could use a more intuitive interface."

### Use Case

- "Include 5 new capnography waveforms under the PALS scenario tab."
- "Add tooltips to explain advanced settings in the scenario editor."

### Additional Context
Any other relevant information, such as:
- Specific medical scenarios (e.g., ACLS, NRP) where this would apply.
- Examples from other simulators or apps.
